## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **Device Not Found**
   - Ensure ESP32 is powered and running unified firmware
   - Check device name is "ESP32_Unified_Sensor"
   - Verify ESP32 is in BLE advertising mode

2. **Connection Timeout**
   - Move closer to ESP32 (within 10m)
   - Restart ESP32 and try again
   - Check for BLE interference

3. **Mode Switch Failures**
   - Allow 2-3 seconds between mode changes
   - Use "STATUS" command on ESP32 serial monitor
   - Restart ESP32 if stuck in one mode

### Data Issues
1. **No Data Received**
   - Check ESP32 serial monitor for errors
   - Verify sensor connections (I2C, power)
   - Ensure proper sensor initialization

2. **Erratic Readings**
   - Check sensor placement and contact
   - Verify power supply stability
   - Look for loose connections

### Performance Issues
1. **Slow Plot Updates**
   - Reduce plot update frequency in code
   - Close other Bluetooth applications
   - Use lightweight version for better performance

2. **High CPU Usage**
   - Increase data processor sleep time
   - Reduce buffer sizes
   - Close unnecessary applications
