## Hardware Connections

### I2C Sensors (SDA=21, SCL=22)
- MAX30100 pulse oximeter
- ADXL335 accelerometer

### Analog Sensors
- FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor) â†’ Pin 35

### Power Requirements
- 3.3V for sensors
- USB/5V for ESP32

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find BLE device | Check ESP32 is powered and running |
| Sensor init failed | Check I2C wiring (SDA=21, SCL=22) |
| No data received | Send `STATUS` command to check mode |
| Wrong sensor readings | Try `RESET` command then restart mode |
| Mode won't switch | Wait 2-3 seconds between mode changes |
| Memory errors | Check Serial monitor for heap info |

## Serial Monitor Debug (115200 baud)
- Shows detailed status and errors
- Displays BLE connection events  
- Reports sensor initialization results
- Memory usage information

## Python Test Client
Run `python esp32_test_client.py` for interactive testing and demos.
